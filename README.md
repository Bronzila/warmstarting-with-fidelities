# WarmstartingWithFidelitites
This framework allows continuation for the fidelities data subsets and epochs in the field of multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization.
It allows for various experimentation and thorough result logging as well as their visualization.

It is a project created during the [Deep Learning Lab course 2022](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss22/laboratory-deep-learning-lab) of the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg.

conda create -n warmstarting python=3.7
conda activate warmstarting

# Install for usage
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run an experiment defined in config.yml
python run.py --config=config.yml
```

## Usage
